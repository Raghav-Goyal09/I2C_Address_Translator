# I2C_Address_Translator
FPGA-based I²C address translator that allows multiple devices with the same default address to coexist on one bus. Acts as an I²C slave upstream and master downstream, remaps addresses dynamically, and supports read/write forwarding. Includes RTL, testbench, simulations, and documentation.
